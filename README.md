# Business Forms

`https://forms.business.nj.gov/<FORM>`

Where `FORM` is the name of a directory with an `index.html` file, which generally ocntain a simple iframe pass-through to a hosted form.

Web hositing through GitHub Pages with DNS pointed in Azure.

NOTE: when first pushing a new `docs/FORM/index.html` file, GitHub Pages tends to immediately resolve `/FORM/` but takes a few minutes for `/FORM` to establish a redirect. Just wait a few minutes for that to happen.
